README: CCG COMPUTATIONS
==


This collection of scripts and functions is designed to accept 
as input a "maximal" cross-correlogram, build a filtered family
of graphs compute betti curves (and persistent homology) of
that family. 

There are several additional scripts which compute graph 
laplacians and various controls for the given dataset as well.
These should be run following the initial data computation, as 
they rely on various components thereof.

In order to use these scripts, one must have the 
neural-codeware Cliquer and Graph classes installed, as well
as the Perseus persistent homology software package. 

The main scripts should be run in the following order:

  SETUP COMPUTATIONS

  BUILD FILTERED MATRICES AND COMPUTE BETTIS

The first script needs to be edited to reflect the settings
desired for the data file and controls before it is executed. 
The second script decomposes the CCG matrix into a thresholded
family of graphs, then uses Cliquer and Perseus to compute the 
persistent homology of the family of graphs.

There are two optional scripts, which can be run after 
BUILD FILTERED MATRICES AND COMPUTE BETTIS is complete:

 * COMPUTE GRAPH LAPLACIANS

This script constructs graph Laplacians for both the weighted
graphs and the families of filtered binary matrices built from 
the data, as well as the spectra of such. 

 * 

 * BUILD GEOMETRIC GRAPH CONTROLS AND COMPUTE BETTIS

This script builds a family of "CCG" graphs by dropping
points (equal to the number of neurons in the data)
uniformly in various Euclidean spaces and then runs the
same process usually performed on the other controls on
this family of matrices.
