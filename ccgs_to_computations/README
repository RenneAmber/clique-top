% README: CCGS TO COMPUTATIONS
%
% This collection of scripts and functions is designed to accept 
% as input a "maximal" cross-correlogram, build a filtered family
% of graphs along with WME and Shuffled CCG (ER) control families
% and then to compute betti curves (and persistent homology) of
% those families. There are two optional scripts which compute
% graph laplacians and uniform geometric graph controls for the
% given dataset as well.
%
% In order to use these scripts, one must have the 
% neural-codeware Cliquer and Graph classes installed, as well
% as the Perseus persistent homology software package. 
%
% The main scripts should be run in the following order:
%
%   SETUP COMPUTATIONS
%   BUILD FILTERED MATRICES AND CONTROLS
%   COUNT CLIQUES AND RUN PERSEUS
%
% The first script needs to be edited to reflect the settings
% desired for the data file and controls before it is executed. 
% The second script decomposes the CCG matrix into a thresholded
% family of graphs, uses it to create WME and ER controls and 
% similarly decompose those. The last script uses Cliquer and 
% Perseus to compute the persistent homology of the 
% families of graphs.
%
% There are two optional scripts, which can be run after 
% BUILD FILTERED MATRICES AND CONTROLS is complete:
%
%   COMPUTE GRAPH LAPLACIANS
%   BUILD GEOMETRIC GRAPH CONTROLS
%
% The first constructs graph Laplacians for both the weighted
% graphs and the families of filtered binary matrices built from 
% the data, as well as the spectra of such. 
%
% The second builds a family of "CCG" graphs by dropping
% points (equal to the number of neurons in the data)
% uniformly in various Euclidean spaces and then runs the
% same process usually performed on the other controls on
% this family of matrices.
