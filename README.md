README: CliqueTop
===

CliqueTop is a collection of matlab scripts for doing topological analysis of symmetric matrices.

The syntax for using the package is 

compute_clique_topology(A)

for any symmetric matrix A. Options and details can be found in the documentation for the compute_clique_topology function.

CliqueTop currently relies on the following software package, which is included in this repository for convenience and should require no further installation:

 * For persistent homology computations, we make use of Perseus by Vidit Nanda. As of this writing, the current version can be found at http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~vnanda/perseus/index.html. We recommend using the snapshot provided in this repository, as the input/output format for Perseus may change in the future.
