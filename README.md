README: CliqueTop
===

CliqueTop is a collection of matlab scripts for doing topological analysis of correlation data. It was initially designed to study the persistent homology of cross-correlations between neuron spike recordings, but it can easily be adapted to work with any data correlation matrices.

The scripts are currently separated into two groups: those which accept as input neural spike train data and output cross-correlogram arrays, located in the folder data_to_ccgs, and those which accept as input CCG arrays and output various topological invariants and controls, located in ccgs_to_computatoins.
